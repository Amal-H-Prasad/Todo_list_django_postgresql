# Todo_list_django_postgresql

A to-do list web application using Python and Django would allow users to create and manage a list of tasks that they need to complete. The project would involve creating a Django application with a database backend to store the list items.

To create a to-do list using Django, you can follow these steps:

1.Set up a Django project and create a new app for your to-do list.

2.Define a model for the to-do list items in your app's models.py file. For example, you might create a model with fields like "title", "description", "due_date", and
"completed".

3.reate a view for displaying the to-do list items. This view should retrieve the items from the database and render them in a template.

4.Create a template for displaying the to-do list items. This template should iterate through the items and display their fields in a table or list.

5.Create a view for adding new to-do list items. This view should handle both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, it should render a form for creating a new item. 
For POST requests, it should validate the form data and create a new item in the database.

6.Create a view for editing existing to-do list items. This view should handle both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, it should render a form pre-populated with
the current values of the item's fields. For POST requests, it should validate the form data and update the item in the database.

7.Create a view for deleting to-do list items. This view should handle POST requests and delete the item from the database.

8.Add URLs for each of the views in your app's urls.py file.

9.Create navigation links in your template to navigate between the different views.

1With these steps, you can create a functional to-do list using Django. Of course, you may want to add additional features like user authentication or 
sorting/filtering the list items, depending on your needs.
